/**
 *  RTSMediaPlayerController is inspired by the MPMoviePlayerController class.
 *  A media player (of type RTSMediaPlayerController) manages the playback of a media from a file or a network stream. You can incorporate a media player’s view into a view hierarchy owned by your app, or use a RTSMediaPlayerViewController object to manage the presentation for you.
 *
 *  The media player controller posts several notifications, see the notifications section.
 *
 *  Errors are handled through the `RTSMediaPlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification` notification. There are two possible source of errors: either the error comes from the dataSource (see `RTSMediaPlayerControllerDataSource`) or from the network (playback error).
 *
 *  The media player controller manages its overlays visibility. See the `overlayViews` property.
