/**
 *  Call one or several blocks during playback of an associated player. A playback time observer is similar to a 
 *  periodic time observer, but its periodic execution is reliable. 
 *
 *  A periodic time observer namely executes the associated block (only a single one) not only during playback at
 *  regular time intervals, but also when the player status changes. This leads to more calls than expected when 
 *  a task must be performed in a reliable regular fashion.
 *
 *  Since a playback time observer calls the associated blocks only when the associated player is actually playing,
 *  stream information (e.g. duration, current time) is available and reliable within a block implementation. A
 *  playback time observer can therefore also be used to update information only available during playback
 *  (e.g. stream position, remaining time).
